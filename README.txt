Generator of crasch accident

This generator contains 5 files

Position:
	# generating of two position, which are not same
	# basic position is defined between 0m and 500m
	# for generating is used random function in for cycles for generating 10 positions

Objects:
	# definiton of three objects: Pedestrian, Rider and Vehicle
	# each class has 4 attributes and 3 methods
	# each of them has some specific values for atributes or methods

Main test:
	# definition of 2 specific test 
	# method times return time of accident and it's given by physic equtions
	# method place issue return place of colision and it's given by physic equations

Testing
	# generating of objects dataset 

Generator
	# contains data from all files and works with them
	# generating 10 accidents
	# it takes random data from dataset
	# solution is convert to graphs and export data to CSV file "Data_export"
